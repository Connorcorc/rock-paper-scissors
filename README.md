## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module.

The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
